## About Niramoy

Niramoy (‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßü, meaning "Cure" or "Healing") is an innovative, generative AI-powered web application built with a profound mission: to empower community health workers in rural Bangladesh. Born from the belief that healthcare should be accessible, simple, humane, and delivered in the local language, Niramoy addresses the critical need for primary healthcare support in underserved regions.

Every day, countless individuals in remote areas of Bangladesh seek basic healthcare from community clinics. However, health workers often face challenges in quickly understanding symptoms, making timely decisions, providing necessary advice, or knowing where to refer patients, especially when adequate doctors or resources are scarce. Niramoy steps in as a trusted companion to bridge this gap.

This intelligent, Bengali-first chatbot assists community healthcare workers by: 
- **Analyzing Symptoms:** When a patient's name, age, gender, and initial symptoms are entered, Niramoy intelligently analyzes the input.
- **Asking Follow-up Questions:** It then generates relevant, empathetic follow-up questions in Bengali to gather more specific and nuanced information.
- **Providing Probable Diagnoses & Recommendations:** Based on the collected information, Niramoy offers probable diagnoses, recommended care actions (including suggestions for common over-the-counter Bangladeshi medicines), and outlines suggested diagnostic tests‚Äîall explained in simple, clear Bengali.

Our vision is to equip every health worker with the technological assistance needed to make confident and informed decisions. We aspire for every mother, every farmer, every child to receive accurate advice at the right time. Niramoy is not just a piece of technology; it's a new way to stand by people, ensuring healthcare is inclusive, language-friendly, and heartfelt. We are continuously developing this chatbot in alignment with local health policies to ensure it remains increasingly efficient and supportive.

## Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Symptom Analysis
The core of the application is a conversational chat interface where a health worker can get AI-driven assistance.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  The user enters the patient's details: name, age, gender, and initial symptoms in Bengali.
    2.  A Genkit flow powered by **Google Gemini** analyzes this input and generates relevant, empathetic follow-up questions to gather more specific information.
    3.  Based on the user's answers, another Gemini-powered flow provides a **probable diagnosis**, **recommended care actions** (including suggestions for common over-the-counter Bangladeshi medicines), and **suggested diagnostic tests**.
    4.  A strong disclaimer to consult a registered doctor is always included with any medical advice.

### 2. Medical Report Analyzer
This feature helps demystify complex medical reports for both health workers and patients.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  The user uploads a picture of a medical report. An optional **cropping tool** allows the user to focus on the most relevant sections of the image.
    2.  The image is first sent to the **Meta Llama 3.2 Vision** model via the OpenRouter API. This model performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and extracts the technical data from the report.
    3.  The extracted technical text is then passed to **Google Gemini**.
    4.  Gemini's role is to translate this complex information into simple, understandable Bengali. It explains each medical term and provides the correct **normal range (‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ)** for each test from its own knowledge base, ensuring accuracy even if the original report is unclear.

### 3. Drug Dictionary (Bangladesh)
Provides detailed information about medicines commonly available in Bangladesh.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  The user searches for a drug by its brand name (e.g., "Napa").
    2.  The app uses the **Tavily Search API** to find information specifically from reliable Bangladeshi medical sites like `medex.com.bd` and `medeasy.health`.
    3.  The search results are passed to **Google Gemini**, which structures the information into a clear, organized format in Bengali, including the generic name, overview, dosage, side effects, and estimated price.

### 4. Find a Specialist
Helps users find the right type of doctor based on their symptoms and location.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  The user enters their symptoms and location (city, state, country).
    2.  The app uses **Google Gemini** to determine the most appropriate medical specialty (e.g., Cardiologist, Dermatologist).
    3.  It then uses the **SerpApi** to perform a Google search for that specialist in the specified location.
    4.  The results are compiled into a helpful Markdown report listing recommended doctors or clinics.

### 5. English-Bengali Medical Dictionary
A handy tool for looking up medical terms.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  The user enters an English medical term.
    2.  The app calls the **Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary API** to get the official definition, part of speech, and pronunciation.
    3.  The English definition is then translated into simple Bengali using **Google Gemini**, making it accessible to local users.

### 6. Multilingual and Theming Support
The entire user interface can be switched between **English** and **Bengali**. It also supports both **light** and **dark** themes to ensure comfortable use in any lighting condition.

## How It Works: Technology Stack

Niramoy is built on a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack.
