    "aboutP1": "Niramoy's (meaning \"Cure\" or \"Healing\") journey begins with the profound belief that healthcare should be accessible, humane, and available in the local language for everyone. In the remote areas of Bangladesh, countless people visit community clinics daily for primary healthcare needs. However, health workers often face challenges in quickly understanding symptoms, making swift decisions, providing necessary advice, or deciding where to refer a patient, especially when there's a lack of adequate doctors or resources.",
    "aboutP2": "Niramoy steps in as a trusted companion to bridge this gap. This intelligent, Bengali-first chatbot is meticulously designed to assist community healthcare workers by: <ul><li><b>Analyzing Symptoms:</b> When a patient's name, age, gender, and initial symptoms are entered, Niramoy intelligently analyzes the input.</li><li><b>Asking Follow-up Questions:</b> It then generates relevant, empathetic follow-up questions in Bengali to gather more specific and nuanced information.</li><li><b>Providing Probable Diagnoses & Recommendations:</b> Based on the collected information, Niramoy offers probable diagnoses, recommended care actions (including suggestions for common over-the-counter Bangladeshi medicines), and outlines suggested diagnostic testsâ€”all explained in simple, clear Bengali.</li></ul>",
    "aboutP3": "Our vision is to equip every health worker with the technological assistance needed to make confident and informed decisions. We aspire for every mother, every farmer, every child to receive accurate advice at the right time. Niramoy is not just a technology; it's a new way of standing by people, ensuring healthcare is inclusive, language-friendly, and heartfelt. We are continuously developing this chatbot in alignment with local health policies to ensure it remains progressively more skilled and supportive.",
